# yass (Yet Another Storage Solution)
A distributed key-value storage solution written in golang using gRPC.

This is still very much a work in progress...

The main branch uses an in-memory cache service, the redis-branch uses a redis connection as the key-value store. 

## Structure of the application

This codebase contains both the server/cache side code (/backend), as well as a client side package to connect to the server and cache. 


## How to Use

Coming very soon
